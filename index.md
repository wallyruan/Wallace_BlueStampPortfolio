# WALL-Y - your dog's bff
"WALL-Y," which (the name) is inspired by Disney's "WALL-E" and my nick name "Wally," is a robot that moniters and takes care of my dog. It autonomously feeds him treats hourly with the help of the built in mic and speaker.

# First Milestone
My project is the table top robot. Why the table top robot? Well after the modifications that I will undergo, the table top robot will be a robot that has the ability to monitor and take care of my dog (who recently had surgery twice). The table top robot stood out to me because it has edge and obstacle detecting ability, meaning my dog will not be able to roll it off a table/get it stuck. Moving on, the main pieces of the table top robot are the motors, an ultrasonic sensor, and an arduino. First, motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. The motor generates a magnetic field that complements the conductors that carry currents. The interaction allows linear/rotational motion. Next, ultrasonic sensors can find the distance between the sensor and an object. It emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time it takes for the ultrasonic waves to bounce back after hitting an object. In my case, the module allows my robot to avoid obstacles and edges. Lastly, an arduino is a microcontroller. It is programmable and it allowed me to write and upload code. In this milestone, I’ve finished assembling and coding the table top robot base kit. The hardest part of assembling the robot was using the nut and screw because of the extremely small size. Subsequently, although most of the coding was straightforward, making the robot go slower took a decent amount of time. This is because I didn’t know the exact speed that I wanted it to go, which meant I had to guess and check until the robot went the speed that I desired. My next goal is the part where I add modifications to the base kit that will pamper my dog.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
